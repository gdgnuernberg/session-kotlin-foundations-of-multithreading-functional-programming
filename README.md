# Session - Kotlin - Foundations of Multithreading and Functional Programming
In this session Nick Skelton - Google Developer Expert for Firebase and passionate Android developer - will talk about Kotlin Flows and Enrique López Mañas - Google Developer Expert for Android and Kotlin - will tell us more about the underlying Kotlin Coroutines. Additionally, WTM Nuremberg presents functional programming advocate for Kotlin Karin-Aleksandra Monoid with her talk on Arrow.kt.

## About the event
We are happy to announce our next session - together with WTM Nuremberg we present a session packed with expert knowledge from two Google Developer Experts and our WTM special guest, Karin-Aleksandra Monoid, functional programming advocate for Kotlin. Nick Skelton & Enrique López Mañas talk about the foundations of Kotlin's multithreading approach. Kotlin Coroutines have not only changed the way how Android and Kotlin developers deal with multithreading they also lay the foundation for the Flow api which is Kotlin's way of realising reactive streams.

Karin-Aleksandra takes the functional approach a bit further by a "Hands-on Arrow" session and she explains how she was able to go all-in for functional programming by using Arrow, the library for Typed Functional Programming in Kotlin.
